After reviewing the plots, one can obtain that the RBGA does well on the sphere and rastrigin problems, but has
difficulties with the rosenbrock problem.
Meanwhile the CMA-ES performs very good on the the sphere and rosenbrock problem, but has its difficulties with the 
rastrigin problem.

After comparing the average best values for each problem, the CMA-ES outperforms the RBGA in the sphere and rosenbrock 
problem, while the RBGA outperforms the CMA-ES in the rastrigin problem.

As said before both algorithm do well on the sphere problem. 
Still, when looking at the best values per repetition, the patterns of the CMA-ES generally seems to be that its return
values often hit a number close to a constant, with a few outbreaks of greater values. If that constant is low,
the average best value remains low as well.
The pattern of the RBGA seems more noisy in general. As in that its best values do not revolve around a recognizable
constant, though they orbit in a close integral, with the exception of the rosenbrock problem.

The CMA-ES outperforms the RBGA in the sphere problem, due to its lack of noise in its pattern.
