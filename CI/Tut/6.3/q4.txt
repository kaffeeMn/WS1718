For the graphical representation of the objektives(see also plots), the solutions have the following coordinates:
i1      (5,9)
i2      (4,10)
i3      (3,12)
with the refrencepoint at:
r       (5,25)


there is no dominant solution, as seen in the plots.

Mathematical proof for that, would be,
that it dows not exist a solution with greater values in both objectives than another soltution.

Now, that there are no dominant solutions, the SMS-EMOA selects by the hypervolume contribution.

The hypervolume calculations are calculated as following:

i1
(5-5) * (10-9) = 0

i2
(5-4) * (12-10) = 2

i3
(4-3) * (25-12) = 13

Obviousky i1 has the smallest contribution to the hypervolume. Hence it will be neglected, while the i2 and i3 will
selected for survival.
